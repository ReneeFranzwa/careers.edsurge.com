[EdSurge](http://www.edsurge.com), the leading source for edtech news, research and tools for selecting edtech products, is looking for a Social Media & Analytics Manager to engage with and grow our audience across K12 and HigherEd. 

We’re looking for someone who is excited about social media and understands how it can be used effectively to grow awareness and drive engagement. Our ideal candidate also knows how educators, administrators and edtech experts are using social channels. You will work closely with leaders from the marketing and editorial teams to develop and implement the social strategy for EdSurge, including marketing campaigns and Twitter chats. Additionally, you will be in charge of all social media analytics and social growth strategies. This is an opportunity to work at the forefront of a dynamic, entrepreneurial team within a mission-driven, ambitious start-up.

### You’re the kind of person who wonders:

* Loves the nuances of social media and can quickly adjust based on data
* Has an active social media presence across various platforms
* Enjoys engaging with people 
* Nerds out about your to-do list and checking things off like a boss
* Is a self-starter with their own ideas but also is able to work collaboratively with a team

### In this job you will:

* Develop, post, and manage written content, photos, graphics, videos, and links on all social channels (with a focus on Facebook and Twitter)
* Craft short and long-term strategy for EdSurge’s social presence; this includes constantly testing new and current strategies, various forms of content, and new campaigns to persistently analyze and improve audience engagement
* Quickly adjust strategy based on the current needs of Sales and Marketing
* Run, organize and advertise multiple Twitter Chats each month
* Run, organize and advertise webinars
* Compile, analyze, and distribute analytic reports (with data from Buffer, Google Analytics, etc.) and social media data to the internal team, regularly making recommendations, updates, and improvements to the social platforms based on your findings. 
* Stay up-to-date with all social channels, industry changes, and emerging platforms; make recommendations based on your findings.
* Manage and develop promotional campaigns across various social media channels (including paid campaigns)
* Get to really know our target audiences and obsess over them including what questions they ask, what their aspirations are and what pain points they have
* Engage relevant influencers and brand advocates in an authentic way
* Respond to the community across various social channels as needed
* Be an integral part of an ambitious, fun and close-knit team within a start-up

### What makes you a great fit for this role:

* You can learn how to use new tools and programs quickly
* You solve problems naturally and comfortably with research, data, and iterations
* You can tackle projects from start to finish with minimal guidance - that includes scoping and diagnosing problems, developing testing methodologies, finding creative solutions, and then implementing changes
* You have a deep understanding of the nuances of social media (1-2 years experience as a social media manager is a plus!)
* You have experience in education and/or deeply understand how educators use social channels
* You are deeply passionate about education (former teaching or volunteering experience within K12 or Higher Ed is a plus!)
* You can analyze and make recommendations based on data (familiarity with Buffer, Chartbeat, and Google Analytics a plus!)
* Some experience with design/graphics (even if it is just using Canva)
* Exceptional writing skills with strong attention to detail, grammar, and tone
* You’re able to move at a fast pace and change course when necessary!
* You love working collaboratively with others and finding ways to reshape and solve their problems

**Benefits**
* Three weeks mandatory vacation (not the "unlimited" that never seems to happen....)
* Employee health care
* Pick your laptop and desk setup (e.g. monitors)
* Locations in both Oakland and South Bay (reasonable commute anywhere from Palo Alto to Berkeley)
* Work from home one to two days a week
