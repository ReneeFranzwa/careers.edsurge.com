[EdSurge](https://www.edsurge.com) is looking for two Reporting Fellows who are passionate about sharing the conversations and ideas that will influence how learners learn—and how teachers teach. As an EdSurge Fellow, you will cover the growing community of education entrepreneurs along with the students, educators and learners they’re supposed to serve.

How has technology shaped how you learn? How might it change how you teach?

These are the questions that drive us—and if they stoke your curiosity, we invite you to apply for a Reporting Fellowship at [EdSurge](https://www.edsurge.com/), the leading source for news about education technology.

We are looking for two savvy reporters and storytellers who are passionate about sharing the conversations and ideas that will influence how learners learn—and how teachers teach. As an EdSurge Fellow, you will cover the growing community of education entrepreneurs along with the students, educators and learners they’re supposed to serve.

We want creative, confident and concise writers who can communicate complex ideas to our audience. Reporting to the Managing Editor, the EdSurge Fellow will:

* Curate and summarize announcements, news and reports;
* Research and produce original stories;
* Review and edit submissions from contributing writers;
* Assist in the creation and delivery of weekly newsletters, podcasts and other media;
* Develop new ways to grow an online audience.

##Here’s what we’re looking for:##

* Outstanding writing and editing chops;
* Ability to work independently under deadlines with minimal guidance (but unafraid to seek help when needed);
* Experience with sharing content on social media;
* Broad understanding of major education issues;
* Familiarity with basic business and finance terms;
* Experience with graphic editing tools (i.e. Photoshop) and HTML/CSS

##Fellowship Terms:##

This will be a six-month, 30 hours per week opportunity with competitive pay in our Burlingame, CA office. We will accept and review applications on a rolling basis until the two positions are filled.

##About Our Team:##

We’re a small, humble staff with a big and growing footprint. We read Quartz and Wired. We sometimes do [science experiments](https://instagram.com/p/uyYpAJSmDy) in the office because—well, why not? And every day we strike that [fine balance](https://instagram.com/p/3wnDxmymMg/) between being serious and [silly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovgx7vtq04k).

##To Apply:##

Please send a resume, links to published work, and a short story about your most memorable learning experience to Tony Wan.
