[EdSurge](https://www.edsurge.com/) is looking for a talented and passionate individual to manage our growing community of innovative educators and entrepreneurs.

EdSurge sits at the intersection of education, technology and business. We’ve cultivated a community of innovators who trespass traditional boundaries: teachers who are intrigued by the power of technology to amplify their practices; entrepreneurs who are thoughtful about the special demands that education makes on emerging products, etc. Community is at the heart of what we do--and we have received awards for building a dynamic edtech community.

We are looking for a community manager who is excited about nurturing this evolving community, and passionate about the big changes going on in education. You’re a good learner and listener, and deft in communications. You should relish both live and virtual exchanges. Your mission is to help EdSurge grow our impact while staying true to our mission: Finding ways to support learners so that all have opportunities to build fulfilling lives.

##In this job you will:##

* Organize and engage in online convenings and dialogue;
* Tweet, share, and engage with online audiences while at live events;
* Gather and manage analytics around social media, and develop strategies to better support our social media footprint;
* Be an independent, pro-active worker but also be comfortable collaborating with teams;
* Rock deadlines;
* Help coordinate Meetups, conferences and other live events;
* Develop new ways to grow an online audience.

##You should have:##

* 1-2 years of online community management;
* A passion for education and learning;
* A results orientation with a high comfort level with managing the analytics behind social media;
* Enthusiasm for social media! You should take a delight in the virtual world even as you look for opportunities to connect virtual and real gatherings;
* A readiness to juggle tasks and dive into projects.

##About Our Team:##

EdSurge is a high growth, venture-backed news and information resource organization that’s at the heart of the rapidly growing education technology ecosystem. We care deeply about our mission to connect the users, buyers and builders of education technology to close the opportunity gap by getting the right tools into classrooms. Our team is high energy, tight-knit and loves great reads, silly puns and giphys. We read Quartz and Wired. We sometimes do [science experiments](https://instagram.com/p/uyYpAJSmDy) in the office because—well, why not? And every day we strike that [fine balance](https://instagram.com/p/3wnDxmymMg/) between being serious and [silly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovgx7vtq04k).
