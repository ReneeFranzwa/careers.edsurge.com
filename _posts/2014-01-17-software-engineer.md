title: EdSurge is Looking for a Software Engineer
---

Hello,

My name is Shu Uesugi, and I'm an engineer/designer at [EdSurge](https://www.edsurge.com/), a SF Bay Area based media startup in education technology (edtech) space. I've been looking for a software engineer to join our team.

If you...

* are a software engineer,
* have heard a lot about edtech recently (e.g. [Udacity launching the first ever online M.S. in CS program for < $7000](http://blog.udacity.com/2014/01/sebastian-thrun-worlds-first-massive.html)), and
* are interested in working at a *promising* edtech startup,

please read on.

### What We Do at EdSurge

[EdSurge](https://www.edsurge.com/) is on its way to becoming the best source of information in edtech. We have [a team of 14 people](https://www.edsurge.com/about), and more than half of us are journalists and education specialists. Every day we report, curate and analyze the products, companies and organizations building edtech.

Particularly in edtech, a great source of information turns out to be quite valuable (and therefore, monetizable). Why so? Well, Paul Graham [said](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html): "[best startup ideas] are something the founders themselves want." And from 37signals' book [Rework](http://www.amazon.com/ReWork-Change-Way-Work-Forever-ebook/dp/B002MUAJ2A): "The easiest, most straightforward way to create a great product or service is to make something *you* want to use."

However, in edtech, this is usually doesn't happen. People who use software in schools are very different from the ones who build software. Each educator needs *information* to understand which software will be most effective for his/her situations, and each entrepreneur/developer/investor needs *information* to understand customers behind the classroom wall.

This is where EdSurge comes in. We help bridge the information gap among key players of edtech, so that each player can make smart decisions. Currently, in addition to our [main news product](https://www.edsurge.com/), we built a [database](https://www.edsurge.com/products/) of ~800 edtech products (written in AngularJS). Our goal in 2014 is to polish our database product and allow educators to participate on our site ([example](https://www.edsurge.com/p/classdojo/reviews)).

We believe that the key to achieving our goal is to invest in and give back to the edtech community. So EdSurge regularly holds events for educators and entrepreneurs--last year we held our biggest one at Computer History Museum in Moutain View, CA, where 600 educators and 30 companies attended ([photos](https://www.edsurge.com/guide/edsurge-tech-for-schools-summits)).

Our CEO Betsy Corcoran, an ex-Executive Editor at Forbes and award-winning writer for the Washington Post and Scientific American, is commited to making EdSurge a success. You can watch a 3 min video of her here:

### Enginering at EdSurge

In terms of hiring engineers, we have only two requirements: we're looking for an engineer such that, by having him/her in the team,

1. the awesomeness of our engineering team is increased sufficiently, and
2. the awesomeness of our company is increased sufficiently.

Below is a quick summary of our engineering culture. See if any of these click with you.

#### Process

We have a small product team at EdSurge--it's me (engineer/designer), [Agustin Vilaseca](http://www.linkedin.com/in/agustinvilaseca) (backend guy), and [Nick Punt](http://www.linkedin.com/in/nickpunt) (product guy). Each of us works on a few different projects, and for each project, we work with one or two education specialists at EdSurge. We try to follow cross-disciplinary collaboration detailed in the excellent [Lean UX](http://www.amazon.com/Lean-UX-Applying-Principles-Experience/dp/1449311652) book.

We use Scrum for project management (with [Trello](https://trello.com/)). We try to work [asynchronously](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/) by utilizing Google Docs, Hipchat, and [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html). I'm a huge fan of the 37signals' new book [Remote](http://37signals.com/remote/), and we're open to discussion for potentially working from home part time/full time. We also peer-review every pull request.

#### Tech Stack

Heroku + Rails 3.2.x (currently upgrading to > 4.0) + PostgreSQL + MemCache. [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) for fulltext search. AngularJS for our [edtech database product](https://www.edsurge.com/products/). [Redactor](http://imperavi.com/redactor/) for authoring content. Rspec for testing, devise for logins, and delayed_job for queuing. Uses [draper](https://github.com/drapergem/draper) heavily for presentation logic. Our SASS code follows [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/).

#### Open Source

We wouldn't be at where we are now without the power of open source, and our goal in 2014 is to give back to the open source community. For starters, this page you're looking at is [open sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/edsurge/careers.edsurge.com), and built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), [Buttons](http://alexwolfe.github.io/Buttons/), and [Fitvids.js](http://fitvidsjs.com/).

#### Learn about Edtech

We're probably the best company to join for engineers who want to learn about edtech. That's why I joined too. You'll get to learn from edtech experts in our team and attend edtech conferences (and get a lot of attention from educators; they'd be like, "omg you work at EdSurge!").

### Working at EdSurge

Our office is at 1801 Murchison Drive, Burlingame, CA ([Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/maps?t=m&q=1801+Murchison+Drive%2C+Burlingame%2C+CA)). It's ~12 min walk from Millbrae Caltrain/BART station and equidistant from highway 101 and 280. Some commute from Berkeley/Oakland, some commute from Mission/Castro, and some commute from Redwood City/Menlo Park.

Parking is abundant, and since we're so close to SFO, many of us park our car at the office when we travel.

[Cafe Roma](http://www.cafferoma.com/) is located down the street for delicious coffee/lunch. We have a little kitchen and a fridge at our office.

Salary/equity is negotiable. We provide health, dental, and vision insurance plans.

### Apply

Email me a cover letter and relevant links (GitHub profile/projects). If you're thinking: "huh? cover letter?"--please read DHH's post ["Forget the resume, kill on the cover letter"](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1748-forget-the-resume-kill-on-the-cover-letter).

We also believe in [hiring by auditions](http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/01/hire-by-auditions-not-resumes/) and [hiring for culture](http://joel.is/post/61468652377/what-no-one-talks-about-when-building-a-team-letting). That means we won't do coding interviews, but instead we'd like to give you a short, well-paid contract project before bringing you on for full time. That's how I was hired too. It was great because during my contract period, both EdSurge and I learned that we're good fit for each other.

Enough talk. My email is shu@edsurge.com. Would love to hear from you.

P.S. If you have any questions, email me or message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chibicode). You can follow me too--I tweet about code a few times a day. If you want to learn more about me, read my [blog post](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/fe6a2067d770), which somehow became the top 50 most read post on Medium in August 2013.
