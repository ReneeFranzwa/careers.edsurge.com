[EdSurge](http://www.edsurge.com), the leading source for edtech news, research and tools for selecting edtech products, is looking for a K-12 Events Manager to run and develop several K-12 in-person and virtual events and initiatives.

We’re looking for someone who has experience in education and a passion to bring people together. In this role you will manage and plan ongoing EdSurge events, including meetups, townhalls and conferences. This person should have a deep understanding of our target audiences (educators, administrators and edtech companies) and develop content and programming that drives engagement. You will work closely with both our marketing and events teams to co-run in-person town halls, and our large Fusion Conference in November. This is an opportunity to work at the forefront of a dynamic, entrepreneurial team within a mission-driven, ambitious start-up.

### You’re the kind of person who wonders:

* Loves meeting and engaging with people, especially educators
* Has a visible, influential presence both online and offline
* Speaks “educator,” preferably because you’ve worked in schools before
* Nerds out about your to-do list and checking things off like a boss
* Is a self-starter with own ideas but also is able to work collaboratively with a team

### In this job you will:

* **Plan and run in-person events** around the country, specifically educator-facing town halls
* **Cultivate relationships with local organizers** around the country and provide ongoing support for local event management
* **Collaborate with the EdSurge events team** to create the first-ever EdSurge three-day conference, Fusion (this will include creating content and activities for the conference)
* **Plan and run sponsored online webinars**
* **Develop and support relationships with potential event partners** 
* Collaborate with EdSurge’s editorial and marketing teams to **promote in-person and online events**
* **Set and meet attendance goals** for each of the aforementioned events
* Be an integral part of an **ambitious, fun and close-knit team** within a start-up

### What makes you a great fit for this role:

* You have experience managing projects from start to finish with minimal guidance - that includes scoping and diagnosing problems, developing testing methodologies, finding creative solutions, and then implementing changes
* You have some experience running events (either online or offline)
* You have at least 1-3 years of teaching/administrative experience
* You are deeply passionate about improving the use of technology in education
* You are comfortable presenting in front of people 
* Solid writing skills with strong attention to detail, grammar, and tone
* You’re able to move at a fast pace and change course when necessary!
* You love working collaboratively with others and finding ways to solve problems
* You are able to travel up to 25% of the time

**Benefits**
* Three weeks mandatory vacation (not the "unlimited" that never seems to happen....)
* Employee health care
* Pick your laptop and desk setup (e.g. monitors)
* Locations in both Oakland and South Bay (reasonable commute anywhere from Palo Alto to Berkeley)
* Work from home one to two days a week
