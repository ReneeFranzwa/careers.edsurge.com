## ABOUT SUMMITS

EdSurge Summits are unique events that enable districts to support the smarter use of edtech and help entrepreneurs develop better products for educators. These two-day events bring together hundreds of senior district leaders, teachers and tech coordinators to work with leading edtech companies with a focus on exploration, feedback and professional development. EdSurge runs 8-10 Summits around the country each year. 

Summits are a core part of fulfilling EdSurge’s mission to bridge the gap between the users, buyers and builders of education technology. During 2014, they proved to be catalytic events for local communities, often sparking new projects around using technology in schools. In 2015, we aim to further support these kinds of activities with new types of products / services.
