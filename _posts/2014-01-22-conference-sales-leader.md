[EdSurge](http://www.edsurge.com) (yup, THIS EdSurge) is growing! We are on the hunt for a conference sales person with experience selling sponsorships. Our EdSurge Tech Summits are expanding nationwide and we are looking for someone to work with our team to increase the impact of our Summit and work with large education and technology companies interested in supporting and participating in these events. Have you sold event sponsorships before? Drop a note to tyler@edsurge.com. Continue reading for a more detailed description.

<!--break-->

[EdSurge](http://www.edsurge.com) is looking for a highly motivated sales professional, successful in selling event sponsorships. The ideal candidate would have experience in selling sponsorships to companies for education (technology) conferences.  Additionally, the candidate should also have an understanding of the education technology industry including relationships with large education companies (Pearson, McGraw Hill, etc.) and more general technology companies that provide services to K12 schools (Google, Qualcomm, IBM, Aruba Networks, etc.).

 We are looking for someone who will focus completely on selling medium to large size sponsorship packages to large companies interested in participating in our Tech for Teachers Summits. These Summits have been incredibly successful at creating deep engagement between edtech companies and the users and buyers of education technology products. Reporting to the CEO, this sales leader will be a critical part of the EdSurge team, enabling our company to scale its impact and activities during the year. While it’s a fairly autonomous role, you will be working collaboratively and in parallel with our Conference Manager who handles all elements of the Summits except for sponsorships.  

We have significant brand recognition and contacts in the edtech industry, but this position requires determination and successful execution across the spectrum of the sales process: from developing new leads and relationships to closing the sale.  We will run six Summits in major metro areas across the country in 2014 with even more planned for 2015.

## Major Responsibilities and Expectations

* Responsible for achieving personal sales targets and close rates
* Responsible for generating new business and increasing revenue from new and existing conference clients
* Work with potential sponsors through a standard, measurable process

* Innovative in finding new ways to communicate the value proposition to potential sponsors including senior executives across sales and marketing functions within potential sponsoring organizations
* Develop and maintain ongoing relationships with corporate, advertising, and public relations communities
* Knowledgeable, energetic and passionate for EdSurge Summits
* Other duties as assigned.

## Desired Experience

* Proven track record of reaching sales targets and revenue goals
* 2-4 years of event sponsorship sales experience is preferred
* Ability to work on multiple projects and with minimal supervision both independently and to be self-driven within a team structure
* Ability to strategically identify target audiences and stay focused to achieve sales goals.
* Experience in self-generating sales/sponsorship leads as well as the capability to work off of warm leads.
