## You’re the kind of person who:

- Understands what someone is talking about before they even finish their... sentence!
- Has a favorite Excel function
- Nerds out about your to-do list and checking things off like a boss
- Believes in leadership that values team results, not personal recognition

## In this job you will:

- Track, summarize and analyze KPIs from surveys, google analytics and other qualitative and quantitative data sources
- Work cross-functionally to drive improvement across HE products
- Project manage time-sensitive initiatives of all shapes and sizes from start to finish
- Provide tactical and strategic support to engage more Edtech companies and grow the HigherEd product index
- Drive newsletter conversion and increased subscription through well researched growth tactics
- Develop marketing competencies through a range of topics (e.g. SEO) and tools (e.g. Marketo)
- Collaborate directly with the Strategy and Ops lead for HigherEd
- Be an integral part of an ambitious, fun and close-knit team within a start-up

## What makes you a great fit for this role:

- You have experience operating at both the 30,000 ft view and getting into the weeds within the same conversation
- You can learn how to use new tools and programs quickly
- You solve problems naturally and comfortably with research, data, and iterations
- You can tackle projects from start to finish with minimal guidance - whether that means scoping and diagnosing problems, developing testing methodologies, - finding creative solutions, and then implementing changes
- You’ve managed and influenced outcomes of small teams
- You’re proficient with data analytics tools (Excel would be a baseline)
- You’re comfortable with context switching - thinking through product messaging in one meeting and then building a market size model in the next. Yes - you will have action-packed, meaningful days!
- You love working collaboratively with others and finding ways to reshape and solve their problems

## Benefits

- Three weeks mandatory vacation (not the "unlimited" that never seems to happen....)
- Employee health care
- Pick your laptop and desk setup (e.g. monitors)
- Locations in both Oakland and South Bay (reasonable commute anywhere from Palo Alto to Berkeley)
- Work from home one to two days a week

#### LOCATION
EdSurge has offices in Burlingame, CA and Oakland, CA. Both locations are public transit-friendly.
