## The Position

[EdSurge](http://www.edsurge.com) is looking for a Senior Product/UX Designer to join our cross-functional team. 

## What will you do once you're here?

A typical day might begin in a collaborative design session with a product manager. You’ll tackle a tough problem together by clarifying what the goals are, challenging assumptions, generating design concepts, and producing basic storyboards or user flows. Afterward, you'll take the lead on transforming those high-level ideas into wireframes, mockups, and visual designs.

You'll be flexible and open-minded, and at different steps in your design process, you'll seek design feedback from your teammates both on and off the design team. In addition, you’ll work with product managers and engineers to find an appropriate middle ground between the ideal and the practical.

When it comes time to make a major design decision, you'll be comfortable articulating and defending a clear point-of-view, drawing on your experience, education, and design intuition. You’ll help the team understand the design tradeoffs between the various options. When it makes sense, you'll support your position with data from site analytics, qualitative research, and usability testing. 

You'll manage your own time carefully and balance the priority of this project with the others on your plate, finding opportunities to take pragmatic shortcuts so that you can invest more time and effort in innovative, thoughtful design work where it matters the most. You'll deftly balance reserving blocks of uninterrupted time to enter a productive, creative flow state against being available to the rest of the team when they need to draw upon your design expertise.

Finally, you'll help establish a culture and discipline of thoughtful, consistent design across all of EdSurge, both through the example of the design work that you do directly, but also by finding opportunities to share your knowledge and passion, to educate and inspire others to think about design the way that you do. 

## Your Qualifications

**You embrace iteration and prototyping** with the understanding that the shortest path to a solid design involves experimentation and feedback. You are comfortable building quick-and-dirty prototypes yourself and using them to test your insights and ideas. These could be static mockups, Wizard-of-Oz paper prototypes, simple Keynote presentations, or you might decide to slap something together using Javascript/CSS/HTML. (We won't ask you to write any production code, but you recognize that sometimes a truly interactive prototype is the right approach.)

**You do your research.** Your deep empathy and curiosity drives you to connect with, ask about, listen to, and learn from people from all walks of life. You seek answer through a wide range of research techniques including surveys, observation, interviews, user testing, participatory design, and usability studies. You're also comfortable designing experiments and analyzing data from tools like Google Analytics, Optimizely, and Hubspot to continue informing your iterations once your design is out in the wild.

**You're a systems thinker and creative problem solver.** You love tackling complex systems, processes, and relationships and meeting them head on with elegant interaction flows and clear information architecture. You're fluent at all levels of detail, transitioning deftly from the big picture to the smallest user interactions.

**You're a design storyteller.** You use words and visuals to tell the story of your research, your design intent, and the rationale that connects both to the broader business context. You're able to present, explain, and defend your work with grace, and you can explain your insights and rationale in a way that resonates with non-designers. Not only can you distinguish between "good" and "great" design, but you can articulate the difference.

**You do your best work on collaborative, cross-functional teams** building applications for the web and mobile web. However, you’re also highly comfortable being self-directed and navigating ambiguity. You understand the capabilities and limitations of technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

Minimum three years of experience designing and shipping web and mobile apps. An academic degree in Human-Computer Interaction, Interaction Design, or a related design or behavioral science discipline is preferred, but exceptions may be made.
